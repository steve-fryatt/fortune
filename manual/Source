<chapter title="Introduction" file="Introduction">

<cite>Fortune</cite> is a small module to display a random fortune when the Desktop starts up, under the welcome banner.  It should work on any version of RISC&nbsp;OS from 3.1 onwards.  The module is 26/32 bit neutral and should work on RISC OS&nbsp;5.

</chapter>





<chapter title="Installing Fortune" file="Install">

To install <cite>Fortune</cite> on a system with the new <file>!Boot</file> structure, copy the <file>Fortune</file> directory from this archive into <file>Choices:Boot.PreDesk</file>.

You will need to provide a file of fortunes for the module to use: these are in the form of a text file containing one fortune per line, with a carriage return (ASCII&nbsp;10, the standard for normal RISC&nbsp;OS text files) between each one.  Files like this are freely available on the Internet.  Copy the file into the Fortune directory (a dummy file called Fortunes has been supplied with some rather silly lines in it).

Load the <file>Fortune.!Run</file> file into a text editor.  There is one line that needs to be edited for your specific fortunes file:

<codeblock>
Set Welcome$FortuneFile &lt;Obey$Dir&gt;.Fortunes
</codeblock>

where the <code>Fortunes</code> at the end should be changed to the name of the text file you have supplied. See the comments in the file for more details.

If you are not using the new <file>!Boot</file> you must ensure that the <cite>Fortunes</cite> module is loaded and the two system variables are set up before the Desktop is entered.  How this is achieved depends on how your boot sequence has been built.
