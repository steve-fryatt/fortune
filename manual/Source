Introduction
------------

  Fortune is a small module to display a random fortune when the Desktop
  starts up, under the welcome banner.  It should work on any version of RISC
  OS from 3.1 onwards.  The module is 26/32 bit neutral and should work on
  RISC OS 5.



Installing Fortune
------------------

  To install Fortune on a system with the new !Boot structure, copy the
  Fortune directory from this archive into Choices:Boot.PreDesk.

  You will need to provide a file of fortunes for the module to use: these
  are in the form of a text file containing one fortune per line, with a
  carriage return (ASCII 10, the standard for normal RISC OS text files)
  between each one.  Files like this are freely available on the Internet.
  Copy the file into the Fortune directory (a dummy file called Fortunes has
  been supplied with some rather silly lines in it).

  Load the Fortune.!Run file into a text editor.  There are two lines that
  need to be edited for your specific fortunes file.  The first is

    Set Welcome$FortuneFile <Obey$Dir>.Fortunes

  where the "Fortunes" at the end should be changed to the name of the text
  file you have supplied.  The next is

    SetEval Welcome$Fortunes 4

  where "4" should be the number of lines in the file.  See the comments in
  the file for more details.

  If you are not using the new !Boot you must ensure that the Fortunes module
  is loaded and the two system variables are set up before the Desktop is
  entered.  How this is achieved depends on how your boot sequence has been
  built.
